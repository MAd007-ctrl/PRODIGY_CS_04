# PRODIGY_CS_04
This Python script captures keyboard events and encrypts the keystrokes using the Fernet encryption algorithm. The encrypted keystrokes are saved to a log file. A separate process decrypts the log file using the saved encryption key. The program demonstrates how to log and decrypt sensitive keystroke data securely.
